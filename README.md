### This project won't be maintained for a long time in the future. If anyone is interested in making this plugin live, please tell me. Thank you! Here is a short list of what to do:
- Remove PsudoReflection class which is a nightmare to maintain; separate that code into distinct subprojects with a central API.
- The main code will call this API.
- There is one subproject per major version, each using NMS from Paper.
- Todo: find another way to make the plugin compatible with multiple versions without reflection or NMS.

This is a fork of the original PsudoCommands plugin that can be found here :
https://github.com/ZombieStriker/PsudoCommands

I fixed some bug and added feature more reliable to the new 1.13 selector minecraft version. If ZombieStriker wants me to PR this fork I can do it !
